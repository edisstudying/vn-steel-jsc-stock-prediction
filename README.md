# Price Prediction For Vietnamese Stock

This is an assignment project for class Economic Statistics. In this project, we try to apply machine learning in predicting the future price of four stocks in the steel securities group: HPG, HSG, VIS, and DTL. 

## Data: 
* The data is fetched from Pham Dinh Khanh's vnquant library, which is saved  a folder in the repository. 
* Make API calls to collect stock price data from 2010 to September 2022 using get_data.ipynb. 

## Model
We try the CNN-BiLSTM model and compare its operation for the task with diferent models like CNN, LSTM, CNN-LSTM in the pdf report file.
Overall, the CNN-BiLSTM model proves the predict with higher accuracy than the other models.
