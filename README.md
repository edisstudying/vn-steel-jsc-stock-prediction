# vn_stock_prediction

This is an assignment project for class Economic Statistics. In this project, we try to apply machine learning in predicting the future price of three stocks in the steel securities froup: HPG, HSG, and DTL. 

* Data: The data is fetched from Pham Dinh Khanh's vnquant library (see folder). We make 3 API calls to collect stock price data from 2010 to September 2022 of the three stocks then clean and merge the data to form the "aggregate_data" file for model training.
